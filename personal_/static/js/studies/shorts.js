      summary: "It is June 27th, and a beautiful summer morning, and villagers begin to gather in their town square (the town is unnamed) for the annual lottery.<br><br> This village has only three hundred people, and so the lottery can be completed easily in a single day, and leave time for noon dinner.The children are enjoying their summer vacation. Bobby Martin, Harry Jones, and Dickie Delacroix gather a large pile of stones and defend them from the other boys.<br><br> Adults arrive and stand around talking: the men speak of farming and the weather, and the women greeting each other and gossiping. Eventually the women join their husbands and call to their children, so families are standing together as units.<br><br> Mr. Joe Summers arrives. Mr. Summers conducts the lottery, as well as the square dances, the teen club, and the Halloween Program. This civic engagement stems from his free time: his wife is a scold and he is childless, so the other villagers pity him.<br><br> He arrives in the square carrying the black box, followed by the postmaster, Mr. Graves, who is carrying a stool. Mr. Summers appeals to the crowd for help, and Mr. Martin and his oldest son Baxter come forward to hold the black box on the stool at the center of the square.<br><br> The original black box for the lottery has long since been lost, and the current box is well worn, but the villagers don’t like to upset tradition by replacing the box. Other aspects of the ritual of the lottery have also been lost or forgotten. Slips of paper, which were made up by Mr. Summers and Mr. Graves, have replaced the chips of wood in the box.<br><br> Lists are made of the households and the heads of each household, and Mr. Summers is sworn in as officiator of the lottery.Just as the drawing is about to begin, Mrs. Tessie Hutchinson arrives. She tells Mrs. Delacroix that she forgot what day it was. Tessie joins her husband Bill and Mr. Summers greets her cheerfully. Tessie makes a joke, and the villagers chuckle. <br><br> Mr. Summers points out that Clyde Dunbar is absent due to a broken leg, and his wife, Janey Dunbar, speaks up, saying, “wife draws for her husband.” Mr. Summers asks if she doesn’t have a grown son who could draw for their family, but Janey replies that Horace is only sixteen. Jack Watson, on the other hand, is old enough this year to draw on behalf of himself and his mother.<br><br> Mr. Summers reads the names and the men come forward when their names are called to draw a slip of paper from the box. Everyone holds his paper without looking at it. As the drawing progresses, Mrs. Delacroix and Mrs. Graves comment to each other that it seems as if no time has passed since the previous year’s lottery. The women watch as their husbands draw from the black box, and when Janey Dunbar steps forward for her turn, they encourage her.<br><br> Mr. Adams strikes up a conversation with Old Man Warner about the north village, which is talking of giving up the lottery. Old Man Warner proclaims this to be “foolishness.” He says that giving up the lottery is akin to going back to living in caves, or to nobody working any more. He says that “there’s always been a lottery” and that it’s “bad enough” to see the light-hearted tone Joe Summers takes as he runs the ritual.<br><br>  As Old Man Warner’s name is called, he reminds the crowd that it’s the seventy-seventh year he has been in the lottery.Once every man has drawn, the slips of paper are unfolded simultaneously and every one begins to ask, “who is it?” The word spreads through the crowd that Bill Hutchinson has the marked slip of paper.Tessie Hutchinson suddenly shouts at Mr. Summers, “you didn’t give him time enough to take any paper he wanted,” and, “it wasn’t fair!” Mrs. Delacroix and Mrs. Graves remind her to “be a good sport” and that they “all took the same chance.”<br><br>  Bill Hutchinson says, “shut up, Tessie.” Mr. Summers asks if there are any other households included with the Hutchinsons, and Tessie points out her daughter Eva and Eva’s husband Don, saying they ought to take their chance with everyone else. But Mr. Summers reminds Tessie that daughters draw with their husband’s family.<br><br> The Hutchinsons have three children: Bill Jr., Nancy, and little Davy. The children, Bill, and Tessie each draw another slip of paper from the black box. Mr. Graves helps little Davy draw and holds his paper for him. Nancy’s school friends watch as she goes forward to draw from the box. Tessie appeals to the people around her and looks around defiantly, but draws a slip of paper.<br><br> When Mr. Graves opens Davy’s paper and reveals that it is blank, the crowd sighs in relief. Bill Jr. and Nancy open theirs and, laughing, happily hold them up to the crowd. Bill’s slip of paper is blank as well. He goes over to his wife and forces the paper from her hand.<br><br>  It’s the marked slip, with a dot in pencil Mr. Summer drew the night before.Mr. Summers says, “let’s finish quickly.” The villagers have forgotten much of the original ritual, but they remember to use stones, which they gather up as they run at Tessie.<br><br>  Someone gives little Davy a few pebbles. Old Man Warner urges the crowd onward. Tessie cries, “it isn’t fair, it isn’t right,” before she is overwhelmed by the villagers and stoned to death.",

      bio:'Katherine Mansfield was born in 1888 in newZealan. In 1893 the family moved to the countryside. Mansfield was extremely happy in rural New Zealand and drew upon her childhood memories in later stories such as “Prelude.” Mansfield wrote fiction from a young.',

      themes: ["Sexuality and Desire: Katherine Mansfield’s short story “Bliss” chronicles a day in the life of thirty-year-old Bertha Young. Bertha’s feeling of “bliss” in the story comes from her attraction to Pearl Fulton, a woman she has recently become friends with. Although Bertha is married, she comes across as sexually naïve and has never “desired” her husband. Not coincidentally, she feels sexually attracted to him “for the first time in her life” on the night of the dinner party when Pearl is present",
      "Women’s Roles and Social Constraint: A large part of the narrative tension in “Bliss” derives from the fact that Bertha Young, the thirty-year-old protagonist, feels a great sense of joy that she wishes to express. However, the constraints of the society in which she lives, and the rigid constraints placed on women in this society in particular, prevent Bertha from expressing her titular bliss.",
      "Aesthetics, Appearance, and Performance: “Bliss” is written in a Modernist style, reflected in the focus on aesthetics throughout the story. Bertha herself is preoccupied with external appearances. Although this may come across as shallow, Bertha’s desire to make things beautiful is an attempt to express her feeling of “bliss” Bertha is also interested in interpreting the appearance of others; as she watches guests interact at her dinner party"
    ],

      summary: "The story follows a dinner party given by Bertha Young and her husband Harry.The story starts with Bertha in a blissful mood as her party approaches, as she considers the specialness and unconventionality of her mood. The maid has prepared a colourful fruit tray for the party, which Bertha will arrange. The nanny is feeding the baby, who reluctantly lets Bertha hold her. The moment of connection with her daughter brings her more bliss.After a phone call from her husband, who is running late, Bertha thinks ahead to who will attend the party that evening. A couple, Mr. and Mrs. Norman Knight (close friends to Bertha and Harry), Eddie Warren, a neurotic and sought-after writer, and Pearl, a strange, mysterious young woman that Bertha has taken a liking to after meeting at a club. As she prepares the drawing room cushions, Bertha recalls how Harry has declared that he finds Pearl dull. She is sure there is much more to her. Her feeling of bliss continues as she hugs the cushions and looks over the balcony to a most perfect blossoming pear tree in the garden, which she imagines as a symbol of her own life. She lists to herself some of the many aspects of her life she is grateful for, and finds that her outfit is even reminiscent of the tree.As the guests start to arrive, with Mr and Mrs Norman Knight calling each other nicknames and Eddie complaining about his taxi, she notes their outfits and appreciates how attractive the company is. As Harry arrives late, she considers the charm of her husband's eccentricities. Pearl is the last to arrive and, as Bertha takes her arm to lead her to the dining room, she feels an intense yet unspoken intimacy with her guest.With everyone present, the meal begins. Compliments are paid regarding the food as theatre is discussed, and Bertha is overcome again by a sense of bliss, delighting in the company she has chosen. She thinks of the perfect pear tree in the moonlight in the garden, as she wonders how she can feel so connected to Pearl. She is somehow sure that Pearl must be feeling the same.After dinner, when Pearl asks if Bertha has a garden, she takes it as a sign of their connection and leads her to the garden window. Here, she opens the curtains to reveal the pear tree. The two women stand side-by-side admiring its beauty and in a seemingly perfect moment of mutual understanding and bliss, when the lights are snapped on and the moment ends.They rejoin the group for coffee, cigarettes, and more lively conversation. Bertha thinks about how her husband is being quite rude to Pearl, which upsets Bertha. She decides that she will try to find a way to explain to him what she and Pearl have shared, but also realises that soon the party will end. She fears she will be alone with just her husband but then, for the first time in her life, finds that she is also filled with desire for him. She wonders if this ardent feeling is what all her bliss has been leading up to.As the guests begin to leave to catch their trains and taxis, Harry goes to help Pearl with her coat in the hallway, which Bertha appreciates considering his earlier brusqueness. In the drawing room still, Bertha fetches a book for Eddie to borrow. As she turns her head to peer down the hallway she sees Pearl and Harry in a romantic embrace, secretly arranging to see each other the next day.Not knowing they have been spotted, Pearl returns to the drawing room to say goodbye to Bertha and mentions the pear tree. As the final guests leave, Harry nonchalantly locks up behind them. Uncertain about the future, Bertha runs to her garden window and gazes upon her perfect tree.",

      plot:["Althought there are many events in this short story, it's plotless, it does not have the pyramid of actions where we can find the rising action which then can lead to a climax then a falling action ...etc, however, the whole story is about a dinner (a mmoment) and actions (moments) inside the main action"],

      point : "The story is told from a third person, limited point of view. This means that readers are privy to only Bertha's perspective. In Bliss, all events are filtered through Bertha, and her overexcited way of viewing the world forms the story's narrative technique. That the narration is studded with questions, interjections, and exclamations only emphasizes Bertha's perspective.",

Bertha sees the moon rising when she is looking out at the pear tree before the dinner party and associates this with the transformative potential of the evening, which she believes will bring about some change in her life and lead to the fulfilment of her hidden desire for Pearl Fulton.

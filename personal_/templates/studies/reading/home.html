        II. Extensive and intensive reading
    </h1>
    <p>
        Extensive Reading (ER) is the process of reading longer easier texts for an extended period of time without a
        breakdown of comprehension, feeling overwhelmed, or the need to take breaks.
    </p>

    <p>
        Intensive Reading is focusing on a close reading of dense shorter texts, typically not read for pleasure.

        III. Skimming and scanning
    </h1>
    <p>
        Skimming and scanning are reading techniques that use rapid eye movement and keywords to move quickly through
        text for
        slightly different purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Skimming is reading rapidly in order to get a general overview of the material.
    </p>
    <p>
        Scanning is reading rapidly in order to find specific facts. While skimming tells you what general information
        is within
        a section, scanning helps you locate a particular fact. Skimming is like snorkeling, and scanning is more like
        pearl
        diving.
    </p>
    <p>
        Steps to follow to skim:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Read the <em>table of contents</em> or <em>chapter overview</em> to learn the main divisions of ideas.</li>
        <li>Glance through the main headings in each chapter just to see a word or two. Read the <em>headings of charts
                and
                tables</em>.</li>
        <li>Read the entire <em>introductory paragraph</em> and then the <em>first and last sentence</em> only of each
            following paragraph. For each paragraph, read only the first few words of each sentence or to locate the
            main
            idea.</li>
        <li>Stop and quickly read the sentences containing <em>keywords</em> indicated in boldface or italics.</li>
        <li>When you think you have found something significant, stop to read the entire sentence to make sure. Then go
            on
            the same way. Resist the temptation to stop to read details you don't need.</li>
        <li>Read <em>chapter summaries</em> when provided.</li>
    </ol>

        IV. Vocabulary in context
    </h1>
    <p>
        Understanding the meaning of unknowen words based on the concept of the passage, following, are some techniques:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Rewording/Restating the word: saying the word in another way
        </li>
        <li>
            Giving Synonym: giving words that almost mean the unknowen word
        </li>
        <li>
            Giving Antonym(the opposite meaning)
        </li>
        <li>
            Giving details abour the word
        </li>
        <li>
            Word formation: dismantling the word by finding its root, and its affixes(prefixes, suffixes)
        </li>
    </ul>

        V. Making inferences
    </h1>
    <p>
        Drawing conclusions refers to information that is implied or inferred. This means that the information is never
        clearly
        stated.
        <br>
        Writers often tell you more than they say directly. They give you hints or clues that help you "read between the
        lines."
        Using these clues to give you a deeper understanding of your reading is called inferring. When you infer, you go
        beyond
        the surface details to see other meanings that the details suggest or imply (not stated). When the meanings of
        words are
        not stated clearly in the context of the text, they may be implied â€“ that is, suggested or hinted at. When
        meanings are
        implied, you may infer them.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Inference</strong> is just a big word that means a conclusion or judgement. If you infer that something
        has happened, you do not
        see, hear, feel, smell, or taste the actual event. But from what you know, it makes sense to think that it has
        happened.

        <span class="tool bg-dark rounded text-white" title="Tooltip on top">Paraphrasing</span> is presenting ideas and
        information in your own words and acknowledging where they come from. By using your
        own words, you demonstrate your understanding and your ability to convey this information. techniques:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Change the structure/order of the sentence
        </li>
        <li>
            Find appropriate synonyms

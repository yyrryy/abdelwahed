                            The allegory, “The Blue Stones,” tells a simple story of a sea captain and his wife. A sea captain

                            captain with two blue gemstones. He places the stones in the eyes of the figurehead. The wife
                            complains that the
                            captain
                            should have made the gemstones into earrings for her. Secretly the wife has the stones removed from

                            replacing them with blue glass.

                                    <em>Jesus’s <strong>parable</strong> of the Good Samaritan in the</em>Bible <em>explores the
                                        meaning of one of the Ten Commandments, to “love thy neighbor as thyself.” In the story, a
                                        traveler is beaten, robbed, and left for dead by the roadside. Several other travelers pass
                                        by
                                        afterward, but only a foreigner stops to help the man. The moral of the parable is that we
                                        should love all people as our “neighbors,” not just our literal neighbors.</em>
